# Java Interview Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to common Java coding exercises for interview preparation.  
It starts from **basic programs** and gradually builds up to **arrays, strings, sorting, searching, collections, generics, lambda expressions, and streams**.

##  Topics Covered
- Basics (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Patterns (stars, numbers, pyramids)
- Strings (reverse, palindrome, anagram)
- Arrays (max/min, duplicates, rotation)
- Searching (linear, binary)
- Sorting (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick)
- Math (prime numbers, factorial, Fibonacci)
- Collections (List, Set, Map, Queue)
- Generics (generic classes and methods)
- Lambda Expressions (functional programming style)
- Streams (filtering, mapping, grouping)

##  How to Run
Compile and run any file using the terminal:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
